# ANUPROQOL
PROQOL applet to asses clinician burnout

This applet is created to allow clinicans and students to easily administer the PROQOL and map their mental health over time. 

The PROQOL tab allows for administration, and the conditional tab opened after submitting PROQOL scores provides feedback and information taken from the site below

Using the googlesheets package to store data, the applet will also allow participants to view their past results by subsetting the googlesheet by their userID. 

# PROQOL
  I do not take any credit for designing the measure, I only wrote the code for the applet. Additionally, the text was taken from the PROQOL manual. 
   Key Contributors are below and the measure can be found here: http://www.proqol.org/ProQol_Test.html. I would also like to thank the developers of the googlesheets() and DT() packages, along with the shiny / rStudio team
